## Introduction

> **Learn the core fundamentals of Docker by building a Node/Express app with a Mongo & Redis database.**

## Work Processings:

(‚úÖ done)

‚úÖ 1. In Docker HUB, install Nodejs Docker image

‚úÖ 2. Install MongoDB Docker image<br>

üìï Just curiosity the reason üëâ when I follow the docker doc to use mongodb image, and want to see my database, I used `mongo -u "mongoadmin" -p "mypassword"` , which didn't work in my bash, THEN I used `mongosh` and it worked. So I want to know the difference between `mongo` and `mongosh`.<br>

```bash
mydb> use admin
switched to db admin
admin> db.auth("username", "password")
```

The difference is `mongo` is a shell, and `mongosh` is a shell for MongoDB with more features and better syntax.ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è <br>

üìó Update-note: In index.js, starting with Mongoose version 6, you should not specify that as an option. It will be handled automatically. `useNewUrlParser`, `useUnifiedTopology`, `useFindAndModify`, and `useCreateIndex` are no longer supported options. Mongoose 6 always behaves as if `useNewUrlParser`, `useUnifiedTopology`, and `useCreateIndex` are true, and `useFindAndModify` is false. <br>

‚úÖ3. Install Redis and Redis Cluster<br>

- Sigup and Signin in RedisLabs<br>
- Troubleshooting in Redis Version 4.0.9<br>
  the error I got

```bash
  Mon, 01 May 2023 04:41:24 GMT express-session deprecated undefined resave option; provide resave option at file:/app/index.js:48:3
  Mon, 01 May 2023 04:41:24 GMT express-session deprecated undefined saveUninitialized option; provide saveUninitialized option at file:/app/index.js:48:3
  Server listening on port 3000

  correct!!!!!!!

```

**Solution 1st** with Redis Version 4.0.9<br>

```bash
const { createClient } = require('redis');
const { REDIS_HOST_URL } = require('../config');

const client = createClient({ url: REDIS_HOST_URL });

(async () => {
    await client.connect();
})();

client.on('connect', () => console.log('::> Redis Client Connected'));
client.on('error', (err) => console.log('<:: Redis Client Error', err));
```

Cannot solve the problem, I got infinite loop for server listening on port 3000<br>

**Solution 2nd** with Redis Version 3.0.2, problem solved üò∂ <br>
Here is the reference I used [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70145795/node-redis-does-not-work-on-my-windows-computer-even-though-the-server-is-up-and)<br>

‚úÖ4. Nginx for Load balancing to multiple node containers<br>

- 2 node instances (port3000) connected to Nginx ‚úÖ<br>
- Express CORS configuration ‚úÖ<br>

Conclusions: This repo is done, all learning and works flow above, the reason I choose this freeCodeCamp [Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zUHg7xjIqQ&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org) because it taught docker compose with many packages (node, express, mongodb, redis, nginx) and how to run 2 node instances <br>
ü§î Probably I don't strong recommend this tutorial, because the Redis version is version3, I got many errors in the work process, I focused on troubleshooting on most learning time, still have one error leave there, I markered in comment.

**If you are interested in this tutorial**

To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies. Code works good.

start the docker containers:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d --build

or


```

check the logs:

```bash
docker logs node-docker-node-app-1 -f
```

stop the docker containers:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml down
```

Not finished parts:
<br> 5. Dev to Prod <-Jump here, because have to installing docker on Ubuntu(Digital Ocean), and deploy to Digital Ocean
<br> 6. Automating <- Setting in Digital Ocean, and Github Actions

## What next?

Docker learning never end...üê≥
