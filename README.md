# 🐳 Dock learning on the wave 🌊

1. In Docker HUB
   install Nodejs Docker image
2. Install MongoDB Docker image<br>
   Just curiosity the reason 👉 when I follow the docker doc to use mongodb image, and want to see my database, I used `mongo -u "mongoadmin" -p "mypassword"` , which didn't work in my bash, THEN I used `mongosh` without user and password input, and I entered the database🤷‍♀️.
